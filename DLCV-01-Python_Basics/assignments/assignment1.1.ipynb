    "# Assignment 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 1 Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Create a single notebook file. Write Python code to complete each of the tasks below in order. Use comments to label each task number in your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Personal Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This task focuses on **variable definition**, **basic data types** (`string`, `int`), and **basic syntax** (`print()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a variable called `my_name` and assign your name to it as a string.\n",
    "2.  Create a variable called `my_age` and assign your age to it as an integer.\n",
    "3.  Create a variable `is_learning_python` and set it to the boolean value `True`.\n",
    "4.  Write a single `print()` statement that uses an f-string to introduce yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Output:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, my name is Alex and I am 20 years old. It's True that I am learning Python!\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Task 2: My Favorite Hobbies\n",
    "\n",
    "This task focuses on **Lists**, the `list()` constructor, and **Set** operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a list named `hobbies_list` containing at least five of your hobbies. Make sure to include one hobby twice to create a duplicate.\n",
    "2.  Use the `set()` constructor to create a new set called `unique_hobbies` from `hobbies_list`.\n",
    "3.  Create another set called `friend_hobbies` with at least three hobbies, where one is the same as one of your unique hobbies.\n",
    "4.  Find the hobbies you and your friend have in common using the `intersection()` method. Store the result in a variable called `common_hobbies`.\n",
    "5.  Print your set of unique hobbies and the set of common hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Output:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "My unique hobbies are: {'cooking', 'gaming', 'reading', 'hiking'}\n",
    "Our common hobbies are: {'reading'}\n",

    "### Task 3: The Ultimate Movie Log\n",
    "\n",
    "This task features more complex **List** and **Dictionary** operations. ðŸŽ¬\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part A: Complex List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a list of strings called `watched_movies` with three movies you have already seen.\n",
    "2.  Create a second list called `watchlist` with two movies you want to see.\n",
    "3.  Create a new list called `full_movie_library` by **concatenating** `watched_movies` and `watchlist` using the `+` operator.\n",
    "4.  Use the `.pop()` method to remove the first movie from your `watchlist` and store its title in a new variable called `just_watched`.\n",
    "5.  Print a confirmation message, for example: `\"I just finished watching [just_watched]!\"`\n",
    "6.  Use the `.remove()` method to remove one movie from `full_movie_library` by its exact title.\n",
    "7.  **Sort** the `full_movie_library` alphabetically in place using the `.sort()` method and print the final, sorted library.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Output for Part A:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "I just finished watching The Grand Budapest Hotel!\n",
    "My final movie library: ['Dune', 'Inception', 'Parasite', 'The Matrix']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B: Complex Dictionary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a dictionary called `movie_ratings` for the movies in your original `watched_movies` list. The keys should be the movie titles (strings) and the values should be your rating from 1 to 10 (integers).\n",
    "2.  **Update the value** for one of the movies in `movie_ratings` to a new number.\n",
    "3.  Add the movie you just watched (`just_watched` from Part A) to the `movie_ratings` dictionary with its rating.\n",
    "4.  Use the `.get()` method to look for a movie title that *does not exist* in `movie_ratings`. Provide a default value of `\"Not Rated\"`. Store the result in `queried_rating` and print it.\n",
    "5.  Use the `del` keyword to **delete one key-value pair** from `movie_ratings`.\n",
    "6.  Print the final `movie_ratings` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Output for Part B:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rating for 'Avatar': Not Rated\n",
    "Final Movie Ratings: {'Inception': 10, 'The Matrix': 9, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel': 9}\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This final task is a quick review of printing different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Print the number of movies in your `full_movie_library` using the `len()` function.\n",
    "2.  Get a list of all the titles from your final `movie_ratings` dictionary using the `.keys()` method. (Hint: You may need to wrap it with the `list()` constructor). Print this list.\n",
    "3.  Print the data type of each of the following variables using the `type()` function:\n",
    "    * `my_age`\n",
    "    * `full_movie_library`\n",
    "    * `queried_rating`\n",
    "    * `movie_ratings`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Output:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "My final movie library has 4 movies.\n",
    "Movie titles I have rated: ['Inception', 'The Matrix', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel']\n",
    "Type of my_age: <class 'int'>\n",
    "Type of full_movie_library: <class 'list'>\n",
    "Type of queried_rating: <class 'str'>\n",
    "Type of movie_ratings: <class 'dict'>\n",
