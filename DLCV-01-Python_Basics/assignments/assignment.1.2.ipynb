    "A Mechatronic student enrolled five courses named `DLCV, Statistics, AINeuroFuzzy, ControlTheory and StochasticModels`. Assume that during the final exam, he has only 12 hours of study left. Furthermore, he must spend at least 2 hours of studying for each course in order to pass the exam. So, he sorts the courses alphabetically and assigns each hour to the course one by one until the total 12 hours is used up.  \n",

    "- When the `coursename` is passed into the function, an hour is assigned to that `course`. You have to loop the list infinitely to pass the `coursename` into the function. The hour assignment will proceed until all the `totalhours` is used up.\n",
    "- When the total hours is used up, the function returns a statement \"All the hours are assigned...\".\n",
